<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![My Image](img/screenshot-demo.png)

:satellite: My Unsplash Backend is the API for the [My Unsplash] (https://github.com/houssam-developer/my-unsplash).

My Unsplash app can be found here: "https://my-unsplash-he.netlify.app/".
Thanks to that challenge, I learn to work efficiently in order to succeed.
And I hope to make more beautifuls websites and become an expert in full-stack development :)

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/rYyhwJAxMfES5jNQ9YsP) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Challenge: Create my Unsplash app. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Create your own API. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- User story: I can see a list of photos in the masonry layout that I have added
- User story: I can add a new photo to the list - the new photo should be on top of the list
- User story: I can search for photos by label
- User story: When I hover a photo, I can see a label and a delete button
- User story: I can delete images
- User story (optional): When I delete an image, I can enter my password
